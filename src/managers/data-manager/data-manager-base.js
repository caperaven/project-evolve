/**
 * @class BaseDataManager - This is the base class used to extend data manager implementations.
 * It contains the basic functionality that all data managers should have.
 *
 * Properties:
 * - count: The number of records in the data manager
 * - idField: The name of the field that is used to identify records (primary key)
 * - eventCount: The number of events that are currently registered
 *
 * Methods:
 * - dispose: This method is called when the data manager is no longer needed. It should be used to clean up any resources that are being used.
 * - setRecords: This method is called to set the records in the data manager. It should be used to initialize the data manager.
 * - append: This method is called to add records to the data manager.
 * - removeIndexes: This method is called to remove records from the data manager by index.
 * - removeIds: This method is called to remove records from the data manager by id (based on the idField as the id).
 * - addChangeCallback: This method is called to register a callback that will be called when the data manager changes.
 * - removeChangeCallback: This method is called to remove a callback that was previously registered.
 * - notifyChanges: This method is called to notify all registered callbacks that the data manager has changed.
 *
 * Methods that should be implemented by derived classes:
 * - getAll: This method is called to get all of the records in the data manager.
 * - getPage: This method is called to get a page of records from the data manager.
 * - getByIndex: This method is called to get a record by its index.
 * - getById: This method is called to get a record by its id.
 * - getIds: This method is called to get the ids of all of the records in the data manager.
 * - updateIndex: This method is called to update a record in the data manager by index.
 * - updateId: This method is called to update a record in the data manager by id (based on the idField as the id).
